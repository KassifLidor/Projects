Wolt-Ish application

I had difficulties running it using the jar files but it works good at my computer.
Sorry for the mess.

Because of a little confusion, I've worked with postgres DB instead of Spring-Data, so it needs to be installed as well.

In Server.Jar file - run the DemoApplication.java class to run the server
In Client.Jar file - run as an angular project (cd to the directory and execute "ng serve")

Client is sitting on localhost:4200
Server listening on localhost:8080

All works according to the requirements.
I didn't have time to write Junit tests.

Also, to add new restaurants and drivers I used postman, I've added the postman-collection to the repository.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.
